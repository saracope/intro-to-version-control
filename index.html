          <h3>If it seems hard, it's because it is</h3>
          <p class="fragment">A Google engineer, speaking to an audience of Google engineers, once described the newly invented Git as:</p>
          <br>
          <blockquote  class="fragment">"a version control system which is expressly designed to make you feel less intelligent" 
            (<a href="https://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8" target="_blank">source</a>)

        <section>
          <h2>Command Line Basics</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>First let's clarify a few terms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Console: This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.</li>
            <li>Command Line: This is the actual line in a console where you type your command.</li>
            <li>Prompt: This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are and other useful info. It typically ends in a $ </li>
            <li>Terminal: This is the actual interface to the console.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Running a Command</h3>
          <p>Nearly all commands follow a common pattern with 3 main parts.</p>
          <pre><code class="command-line">$ ls -l ~</code></pre>
          <ul>
            <li>Program (verb)</li>
            <li>Options (adverb)</li>
            <li>Arguments (object)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Common commands</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="inline">cd</code>: change directory</li>
            <li><code class="inline">ls</code>: list all the files</li>
            <li><code class="inline">mkdir</code>: make directory</li>
            <li><code class="inline">rmdir</code>: remove/delete directory</li>
            <li><code class="inline">touch</code>: create a file</li>
            <li><code class="inline">rm</code>: remove a file</li>
            <li><code class="inline">pwd</code>: find out the file path of current directory you are in, from the root</li>
          </ul>
          <p>terminology note: directory === folder</p>

          <h3>cd (changing directories)</h3>
          <p>A little further explanation...</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="inline">cd folder_name</code>: moves down into the folder</li>
              example: cd my_kittens
            <li><code class="inline">cd path_name</code>: moves down into the last folder listed</li>
              example: cd my_kittens/fuzzball/favorite_foods
            <li><code class="inline">cd ..</code>: moves up one folder level</li>
            <li><code class="inline">cd ../../../</code>: moves up three folderlevels</li>
            <li><code class="inline">cd ~</code>: moves to your home directory, no matter where you are</li>

          <h2>Making a Repo</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>What is a repository (repo)?</h3>
          <p>Essentially, a Git version of project folder.</p>
          <p>Git will track any changes inside of a repository.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Create a Local Repository - Do it with me!</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are inside of your kittens_project
              <pre><code class="command-line">$ pwd</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Initialize it as a local Git repository
              <pre><code class="bash">$ git status
# should show an error because
# we haven't made it a repository yet!
$ git init
$ git status</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>What did we just do?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="inline">git init</code> will transform any folder into a Git repostiory.</li>
            <li>You can think of it as giving Git super powers to a folder so that Git starts tracking any changes in that folder.</li>
            <li>If the command <code class="inline">git status</code> returns no errors, it means your folder has successfully been Git-ified!</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Good repository practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Repos are meant to be self-contained project folders.  'Project' can be how you define it - one html page or a whole app.</li>
            <li>Name folders with all lowercase letters and with no spaces - use dashes or underscores instead.</li>
            <li><span class='pink'>WARNING NOTE</span>: Do not put a repo inside of a repo. Git will get confused and have no idea what changes to track.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>When the feature is done, merge it into master</li>

  <h2>Understanding Repositories</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What's a Repository?</h2>
  <p>A repository (or repo, for short) is Git's name for a project, like a folder. It contains all of the project's files and stores each file's revision history.</p>
  <p class="fragment">On GitHub, each repository has its own page, and includes several other features for collaboration.</p>
</section> -->

<section>
  <h2>Anatomy of a Repo</h2>
  <p>The header of a GitHub repository page includes features that GitHub adds on to Git.</p>
  <img src="images/repo-header.png" alt="header content for the teaching-materials repo" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anatomy of a Repo</h2>
  <p>The file listing displays information common to all Git repositories.</p>
  <img src="images/repo-file-list.png" alt="partial file list for the teaching-materials repo" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Each row contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a file or folder name</li>
    <li>a description of the last change</li>
    <li>when the last change was made</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anatomy of a Repo</h2>
  <p>GitHub treats some files as special based on their filenames.</p>
  <img src="images/repo-special-files.png" alt="list of files including code of conduct, contributing, license, pull request template, and readme" style="max-width:100%;" />
  <p>These files are designed to help with collaboration.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Explore!</h2>
  <p>Explore the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/gdidayton/gdidayton">GDI Dayton website repository</a></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Look at the files with capitalized filenames. What do you think is the purpose of each one?</li>
    <li>Open files with different file extensions. How does GitHub display them?</li>
    <li>Find the most recently changed file. Find the least recently changed file.</li>
    <li>Bonus: find the code for this event.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<!-- Working with files -->
<section>
  <h2>Working with files in the GitHub web UI</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Creating a repo</h2>
  <p>Click the ➕ icon in the upper right corner, and select <strong>New repository</strong>.</p>
  <img src="images/new-repo.png" alt="" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Creating a repo</h2>
  <p>Give the repo a name and a description.</p>
  <img src="images/new-repo-name.png" alt="" />
  <p>Private repositories require a paid account.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Creating a repo</h2>
  <p>GitHub can create some files for you.</p>
  <img src="images/new-repo-readme.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <ul>
    <li>README: an intro page for your project</li>
    <li>.gitignore: useful when using Git on your local machine</li>
    <li>license: terms for other people using with your code</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Adding a file</h2>
  <p>In the button bar above the list of files, select <strong>Create new file</strong>.</p>
  <img src="images/repo-button-bar.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Enter a filename, and your file contents.</p>
  <img src="images/new-file-name.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Adding a file</h2>
  <p>When you're finished, write a commit message and commit the new file.</p>
  <img src="images/commit-new-file.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>We'll talk about committing directly or creating a new branch later.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Uploading a file</h2>
  <p>You can also upload files that aren't text, like images or videos. (These are called binary files.)</p>
  <p>In the button bar above the list of files, select <strong>Create new file</strong>.</p>
  <img src="images/repo-button-bar.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Drag or select one or more files, and commit the changes as you would for creating a file.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Editing a file</h2>
  <p>Navigate to the file you want to change, and select the pencil icon at the top of the file.</p>
  <img src="images/markdown-file.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>The editor view will open, where you can edit the text and commit your changes.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Writing in Markdown</h2>
  <p>Markdown is a simple markup language that many tools use to convert to styled text.</p>
  <img src="images/markdown-edit-view.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Different symbols translate to different HTML elements.</p>
  <p><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">GitHub's Markdown Guide</a></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Writing in Markdown</h2>
  <p>GitHub displays all markdown files as styled HTML. Select the <strong>Preview changes</strong> tab to see how your file will look.</p>
  <img src="images/preview-changes.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Putting files in folders</h2>
  <p>When you create or edit a file, its path is displayed next to the filename.</p>
  <img src="images/filename-with-path.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>At the beginning of the filename field, type the name of the folder followed by <code>/</code>.</p>
  <p>The folder will be added to the path.</p>
  <img src="images/add-file-path.gif" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p> You can do this multiple times, and you can delete folders from the path, too.</p>
</section>

<!-- <section>
  <h2>Creating "empty" folders</h2>
  <p>Git tracks files, so an empty folder is a path that leads nowhere. Git won't track empty folders, and you can't create them in GitHub.</p>
  <p>Work around this by creating an empty, throwaway file and giving it a new path.</p>
  <img src="images/keep-file.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>It's a common convention to call this file <code>.keep</code>.</p>
  <p>You can delete this file later when you've added other files to the folder.</p>
</section> -->

<section>
  <h2>Moving binary files</h2>
  <p>Binary files like images can't be edited in GitHub, so you can't change their paths!</p>
  <img src="images/binary-edit-options.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Instead, you'll have to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the file.</li>
    <li>Delete it from the repo.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the new folder.</li>
    <li>Upload the file again.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new repo, with a README and a license.</li>
    <li>Edit the README, and commit your changes.</li>
    <li>Create a new markdown file with some formatted text.</li>
    <li>Create an empty folder titled, "images".</li>
    <li>Navigate to the images folder, and upload an image to it.</li>
    <li>Add your new image to one of your markdown files. (Hint: use a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files" target="_blank">relative link</a>.)</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<!-- Forks and Pull Requests -->
<section>
  <h2>Forks and Pull Requests</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Forking a repo</h2>
  <p>When you try to make changes in a repo you don't control, GitHub will make a <em>fork</em>.</p>
  <img src="images/github-prompted-fork.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>You can also make a fork by selecting the <strong>Fork</strong> button at the top of the page.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Forking a repo</h2>
  <p>Forking makes a copy of the repo in your account, where you can make changes to your copy however you like. A fork remembers where it came from.</p>
  <img src="images/forked-repo-header.png" alt="repo header with repo name, followed by the name of the repo it was forked from" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>However, new changes in the original repo (usually called the "upstream") will not affect your fork, and changes in your fork will not affect the upstream repo.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Proposing changes</h2>
  <p>You can propose that changes on your fork be applied to the upstream repo by opening a <em>pull request</em>.</p>
  <p>If you try to edit a file in the upstream repo, it will give you this option automatically.</p>
  <img src="images/propose-file-change.png" alt="The usual 'Commit changes' button is replaced with 'Propose file change'" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Comparing changes</h2>
  <p>Before you make a pull request, GitHub will compare the changes you're proposing (on the 'head') against the repo you want to change (the 'base').</p>
  <img src="images/comparing-changes.png" alt="The usual 'Commit changes' button is replaced with 'Propose file change'" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>The comparison looks at a specific <em>branch</em> in each repo. (More on those later.)</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Comparing changes</h2>
  <p>The comparison also includes a detailed view of all of the changes, called a <em>diff</em>.</p>
  <img src="images/compare-diff.png" alt="The usual 'Commit changes' button is replaced with 'Propose file change'" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Creating the pull request</h2>
  <p>When you create a pull request (or PR), you add a comment, explaining your change to the maintainers.</p>
  <img src="images/open-pull-request.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Branches</h2>
  <p>You can work in a branch without affecting the rest of the repo. For example, the "patch-1" branch has changes that the "master" branch does not.</p>
  <img src="images/branch-master.png" alt="The last commit on master is 'initial commit'" style="max-width:100%" />
  <img src="images/branch-patch-1.png" alt="The last commit on patch-1 is newer." style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
  <p>To start making a group of changes together, create a new branch.</p>
  <img src="images/create-branch.png" alt="Select the branch dropdown at the top of the file list and type the name of the new branch." style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>The new branch will include all of the changes from the branch you were on when you created it. Usually you will create the branch from "master," or the main branch.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Committing to a branch</h2>
  <p>With your new branch selected, you can make changes as usual. When you commit new changes, you'll have the option to commit to the new branch.</p>
  <img src="images/commit-to-new-branch.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>When you start committing to the new branch, GitHub will show a prompt to start a new pull request. You can ignore this until you've made all of your changes.</p>
  <img src="images/pull-request-prompt.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Your multi-file PR</h2>
  <p>When you create the pull request from your new branch, the diff will show all commits, to all files.</p>
  <img src="images/multi-file-diff.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Create a fork of https://github.com/gdidayton/memehub</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You will clone the fork and add a new animated gif to the repository.</li>
    <li>Edit the README, and following the prompts to fork and propose the change in a PR.</li>
    <li>Open your fork of the repo, and create a new branch from "master".</li>
    <li>On the new branch, upload an gif file.</li>
    <li>On the same new branch, add a new markdown file with your new image and some text.</li>
    <li>Open a pull request to merge your new branch into the projects "master" branch.</li>
    <li>*Bonus: Do it again also using Git from the command line!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Accepting feedback</h2>
  <p>It's totally normal for a pull request to require changes.</p>
  <p>Don't be afraid to ask questions for clarification.</p>
  <p>Most maintainers are friendly and helpful. If you encounter one who isn't, consider finding a different project worthy of your contributions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Pushing changes to a PR</h2>
  <p>You can edit files in a PR directly from the <strong>View changes</strong> tab.</p>
  <img src="images/edit-in-pr.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />

<!-- Merging PRs -->
<section>
  <h2>Merging a PR</h2>
  <p>To merge a pull request, click the Merge pull request button near the bottom of the Conversation tab of the PR.</p>
  <p>The changes will be added to the master branch.</p>
  <img src="images/after-pr-merge.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Merge conflicts!</h2>
  <p><em>Merge conflicts</em> happen when two commits try to change the same thing, and Git isn't sure which change to use.</p>
  <img src="images/conflict-found.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>This often happens when two people PR changes to the same file, and one gets merged first.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Resolving conflicts</h2>
  <p>When resolving merge conflicts, Git shows the file with both conflicting changes included, bound in special characters.</p>
  <img src="images/resolving-view.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />

<!-- Issues -->
<section>
  <h2>Issues</h2>
  <p>GitHub issues are where collaborators track bugs, propose features, and discuss changes. They are for conversation, and do not actually change code.</p>
  <img src="images/issue-list.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
  <p>Anyone can open or comment on an issue.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Filtering issues</h2>
  <p>Reading a repo's issues is a great way to find out where you can contribute.</p>
  <p>GitHub has several <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/">options for searching and filtering issues</a>, like finding all issues with a "newbies-only" label.</p>
  <img src="images/newbies-only-label.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%" />
